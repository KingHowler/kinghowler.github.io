What are the 3 possible logic states and how do I use them in my circuits?</p> <hr/> <h1 id="logic-states">Logic States</h1> <p>There are 3 logic states:</p> <ol> <li><strong>HIGH</strong> <ul> <li>A <strong>HIGH</strong> logic state can sometimes also be referred as <strong>ON</strong>, <strong>1</strong>, <strong>Positive Current</strong></li> <li>It simply means that this pin is <strong>Active</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>LOW</strong> <ul> <li>A <strong>LOW</strong> logic state can sometimes also be referred as <strong>OFF</strong>, <strong>0</strong>, <strong>Negative Current</strong> or even <strong>Grounded</strong></li> <li>It simply means that this pin is <strong>Inactive</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>FLOATING</strong> <ul> <li>Floating may also be referred as <strong>Not Connected</strong> or <strong>Undefined</strong></li> <li>It is a state that occurs when the pin is not connected to a source or drain. It means that there is no precise logical state and that it can be either 1 or 0</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <hr/> <h2 id="floating-state">Floating State</h2> <p>Today the topic of our discussion will be the <strong>Floating</strong> State.</p> <p><strong>What are the effects of floating state on the circuit?</strong></p> <ul> <li>The <strong>FLOATING</strong> state causes errors in the circuit’s logic by randomly changing values and not triggering circuits as expected.</li> </ul> <p><strong>What causes a floating state to occur?</strong></p> <ul> <li>The <strong>FLOATING</strong> state is caused by shoddy wiring and poor design.</li> <li>It can also occur due to hardware malfunction but it is best to look for faults in the wiring before deciding to change all of the hardware.</li> </ul> <p><strong>How to ensure floating state doesn’t occur in my circuit?</strong></p> <ul> <li>This brings us to our other topic of discussion for today, <strong>Pull-up</strong> and <strong>Pull-down</strong>.</li> </ul> <hr/> <h3 id="pull-up">Pull-up</h3> <p>Pull-up refers to attaching the pin to a source or a positive current through a resistor. This means that the pin will always be in the <strong>HIGH</strong> state unless a negative current is passed. It is important to use resistor to avoid a short circuit between the pull-up and the input.</p> <p>Below is an example where a pin has been pulled up.

It is important to use resistor to avoid a short circuit between the pull-down and the input.</p> <p>Below is an example where a pin has been pulled down.
