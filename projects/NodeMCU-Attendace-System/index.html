The project uses <strong>RFID</strong> (Radio-Frequency Identification) with indicator lights, to record student attendances. A webpage handles the registration of new RFID tags under the name of the student. A second webpage is used to get the attendance records of the entire student body. The system is secure and has 3 custom “<strong>Keys</strong>” to ensure there is no access to any third party or false records made by someone with malicious intents.</p> <h2 id="summary-of-features">Summary of Features</h2> <ol> <li> <strong>RFID</strong>: modern, fast and accurate system</li> <li><strong>LED Indicators</strong></li> <li><strong>Registered students only</strong></li> <li> <strong>Security Keys</strong> : Ensure a controlled access <ul> <li>Key #1 : For marking attendance of students, possessed by “<strong>School Certified</strong>” attendance recorders</li> <li>Key #2 : For viewing the attendance record of the entire school body, possessed by school administration <ul> <li>For a “key-less” viewing of the attendance record, the student must state it’s registration ID (Personal RFID assigned by administration).
