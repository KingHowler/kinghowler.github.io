The plotter gives you many customization options which includes the following:

- Minimum (x, y) coordinate
- Maximum (x, y) coordinate
- Gap between the main grid lines for X and Y axis
- Enable or Disable the Sub-Grid
- Enable or Disable denoting each reading with a dot
- Customize the title of the X-axis and Y-axis
- Baud Rate of the Serial Device
- The port to read data from

The website also provides a link to the code for the website as well as a link telling how to use the oscilloscope locally which offers even more customizable options.
