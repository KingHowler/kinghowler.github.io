My name is Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, born in Pakistan. From a young age, I've been deeply fascinated by the world of technology, particularly in the fields of programming, Physics, Robotics, and Digital Electronics. I spend a lot of my time working on projects that challenge my creativity and technical skills, constantly pushing myself to learn more and innovate.


In addition to my passion for technology, I also enjoy reading books. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or something technical, I find that reading broadens my perspective and fuels my curiosity. When I'm not coding, building, or reading, you can often find me on a sports field. Playing sports is another significant part of my life, keeping me active and helping me maintain a balanced lifestyle. Through all these pursuits, I remain committed to learning, growing, and pursuing excellence in everything I do.
