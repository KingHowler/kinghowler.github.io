My name is Muhammad Umar Shahbaz, born in the bustling city of Lahore, Pakistan. In **6th grade** I somehow stumbled upon a video of **"Intruder Detector"** project using an **HC-SR04** and an **Arduino Uno**. That was how I jumped into the field of **Robotics**. These days **Robotics** is the talk of the world with almost every student trying their very best to become a part of the industry, but back in my day, meaning when I started **Robotics**, people barely knew about it.

**Robotics** is not the only field that gives me "worth". I am also an industrious student when it comes to **Software Sciences** and **Physics**. I have been making softwares since **7th grade**, for that part I don't have a grand story. It was a part of the school syllabus, we were tasked with making a discount calculator for a shop using Visual Studio 2010. You can find a list of my many projects [here](projects/).

Enough talk about skills, let's talk about my hobbies. I am a frequent reader, to be honest I don't read many **Classical** or **Romance** or any other genres a lot. If you ever find me reading a book, there an extremely high chance that I am reading either **Fantasy** or **Crime Fiction**. My favourite novel series include Harry Potter by JK Rowling, Agent 21 by Chris Ryan and Nevernight Chronicles by Jay Kristoff. Other than reading I am also known for playing sports. I have played football in my High School days as one of the most trustworthy defenders. Nowadays I am mostly playing Table Tennis with the rest of my college friends.

I am not great when it comes to academics, my weak memory as well as slow math may make me seem like a liability, but I assure you I have got the skills needed. Although I may not work well under an unreasonably tight deadline, I can still produce amazing results.

My own quote: <br> **I believe that experience is everything. Once you have seen it all, you are the apex.**
